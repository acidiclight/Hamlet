# Hamlet Text Adventure

This is a small C# program that allows you to play the first few scenes of William Shakespeare's *Hamlet* as a choice-based text adventure game.

### Why is it only choice-based?

I know...that's a little boring.  But that's what happens when I don't have 6 months to code an elaborate text adventure engine and study every little bit of Hamlet.  I created this mostly as a way to test my ability to write interactive text-based user interfaces in C# (something I don't do often), and as a creative assignment for Hamlet in my Grade 12 English class.

### Why would anyone want to play this?

Because it's not just a retelling of Hamlet... that'd be insanely boring for me to program.  No, this is my idea of what the first few scenes of Hamlet would be like if they happened in modern times or were written by someone with an extremely warped sense of humor.  I've tried to add my own creative spin to the story while still keeping to the same general narrative as the original play.

### Important notes

 - **I, Michael VanOverbeek, wrote this.** I, Michael VanOverbeek, am not responsible for any bugs or crashes.  Anyone who's seen a Peacenet development update knows that my programs have a habbit of crashing.  That's just the way it is.  I tried not to mess things up in this game, but people make mistakes and I'd rather devote my time to working on The Peacenet instead of working on a text-based game *that barely anyone will play.*

 - **There's a lot of death.** Spoiler alert! If a Shakespeare play has a character's name in it, **they die.** In this case, you as a player have a lot of cance of winning the Darwin awards many times if you make the wrong decision.  Stay safe, friend.

 - **100% Less Shakespearean Language.** NOBODY in this day and age speaks that.  Neither does this game.
